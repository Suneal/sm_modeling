\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we demonstrated and motivated the need for a way to enable then analysis of user-driven routines. We presented a systematic approach of extracting device names, device capabilities, and device state / condition using a combination of state-of-art NLP tools and techniques. We evaluated this approach with the manually labeled result of 250 routines from our user study. The result demonstrated that we were mostly successful in extracting device name from the natural language routines with a 80\% accuracy. However, due to the fact that device capabilities and device condition / states are vague and often represented as complex phases, our straightforward approach were less accurate in extracting the corresponding device capabilities and device conditions. In future work, we can improve this kind of extraction with and  potentially with another layer of extraction so that we can generate more accurate models, thus making generation of intermediate representation more representative when converting to IoT smart apps for further platform-wise testing.
