The main goal of our evaluation is to measure the effectiveness of our models at extracting and transform key device characteristics into their respective intermediate representations. For this study, we focus on evaluating against the existing dataset of 250 user-driven routines.
To test for the accuracy of the models we generated, We first manually went over each routine and produce the intermediate representations. Then, we compare the result of our manual effort with the intermediate representations generated by our models. In the end, our models were able to extract device name, device capability, and device variables with an accuracy of 80.64\%, 58.04\%, and 64.29\% respectively. We were able to extract device name with the highest accuracy because device name often exist as is in the natural text from end-user, and we were able to extract them with minimum effort. This approach is still limited in the sense that it cannot contents that are not inside the given input. This is probably the reason that we are unable to have a decent accuracy fro device capability, which are often are not explicit.
