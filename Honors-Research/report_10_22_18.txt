After setting up the vanilla groovy environment, I tried to run a simple groovy app to see what kinds of error I needed to fix.  It turns out that the only thing we need to take care is the definition and preferences block. The rest of the code would compile fine. For parsing the definition and preferences block, I tried to build a library to parse the blocks. I had never build a library before, so I had to spend some time to read some documentions. After discussing this with Sunil, I figured out the I need to create a capability class (like switch -> on / off), and a device handler. Then I will have to link all three types of file together to run our own smartthings platform.
