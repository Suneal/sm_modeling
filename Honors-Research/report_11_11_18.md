Over the past two weeks, I was working on building a complete list of device handlers. This will be useful in the later part of the project. Although we will need to double check on the correctness of them, but most of them are resue of simulated device handlers from smartthings, just a couple of them needs verification. This week, I was trying to simulate physical event within device handler by calling '''sendEvent()'''. For example, to turn a switch off, we can call "zigbee.command(0x0006, 0x00)", or we can create a new event "event", and call "sendEvent(event))" with event being a Map of what we want to do. It took me a bit of time to figure out what device handler is actually doing and trying to go around it to achieve what we want. Although I was able to accomplish this, I think we we really want is to send a POST request to the hub using another program. I will be doing that in the upcoming week.
