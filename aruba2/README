ABOUT ARUBA:
======================================================================
This dataset contains sensor data that was collected in the home of
a volunteer adult.  The resident in the home was a woman.  The woman's
children and grandchildren visited on a regular basis. The file contains
raw sensor events, no activities are annotated.

The sensor events are generated from motion sensors (these sensor IDs begin
with "M"), door closure sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "D"), and
temperature sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "T").
The layout of the sensors in the home is shown in the file aruba.jpg.

You may download and analyze this data free of charge.  Please do not
distribute the data without explicit permission from the CASAS research group.
Please reference the CASAS project in any publications resulting from using
this dataset.

All use of the data must cite the WSU CASAS smart home project.
