{"action_channel": "iOS Reminders", "description": "This recipe creates a Siri speech-enabled 'Captain's Log' to keep a runningtime-stamped log of the little things you do all day. On it's own, the IOSReminders App doesn't tell you _when_ items were added to the Reminders listsbecause it's focused on reminding you of things that haven't happened yet soyou don't forget to do them. Happily, with an updated Siri and a recent'tweak' to the Reminders App, we can now say things like \"Add Artichokes to myShopping List\" and Siri will do just that. (Of course, you'd have to rememberto look at that shopping list). This recipe is designed to take advantage ofthose new semantics and the fantastic new IFTTT for iOS to work it's magic.Use it to keep track of when you last took your medications, what you had toeat at lunch, or to look back a year from now and remember the moment you metthe person who later became your significant other. All you have to do islong-press the Home button on an IOS device, say \"Add to The Captain's Log\"and Siri will ask what you'd like to add, then IFTTT will update an already-in-progress 'living note', do this often enough and you'll have a greathistorical record of 'the little things in life' In order for this recipe towork great on the first try, you'll want to: 1\\. Open the IOS Reminders app2\\. Create a new list called \"Captain's Log\" (I've found it works betterwithout the \"The\") 3\\. Open Evernote 4\\. Create BOTH a Note titled \"TheCaptain's Log\" and a Notebook titled \"The Captain's Log\" (this time, the \"The\"is included in each) Note: You can (of course) 'tweak' the Notebook name, theNote name, or what the log entry includes if you like, but I've 'unhid' thesefields so that even a novice user can begin using this recipe with very littletechnical knowledge. :-)", "title": "The Captain's Log for IOS", "url": "https://ifttt.com/applets/104584p-the-captain-s-log-for-ios?term=%22smart%20home%22%0A", "times_used": "1500", "permission_event_2": "Append to note", "supported_by": "https://ifttt.com/", "event": "New reminder added to list", "permission_channel_1": "##### iOS Reminders", "permission_channel_2": "##### Evernote", "permission_event_1": "New reminder added to list", "action": "iOS Reminders", "event_channel": "iOS Reminders", "id": "https://ifttt.com/applets/104584p-the-captain-s-log-for-ios", "permissions": 2},
